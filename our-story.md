## Honoring Our Past, Running Toward Our Future

Dover has always had a strong running heartbeat, and for many years <strong><a href="https://six03endurance.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SIX03 Endurance</a></strong> played a meaningful role in bringing people together across the Seacoast. Pub runs, group races, holiday gatherings, and countless shared miles helped create a community that felt welcoming, energetic, and fun. Many of our current members—and our home at <strong><a href="https://thebricknh.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Brick</a></strong>—grew out of that era.

Like many things, the pandemic changed the rhythm of group running. Traditions shifted, routines faded, and the community evolved. But the spirit that made those early days special never disappeared. It simply needed a place to grow again.

{{ site.title }} was created to carry that spirit forward—not as a replacement, and not as a rebranding, but as a continuation of what has always mattered most: people showing up for each other, week after week, to run, laugh, and belong.

We honor the roots that helped shape this community, and we're grateful for the runners, volunteers, and local partners who built the foundation we stand on today. At the same time, we're excited to write a new chapter together—one that's inclusive, consistent, and grounded in the friendships and shared experiences that make running in Dover special.

Whether you've been part of the Seacoast running scene for years or you're lacing up with us for the first time, you're part of the story now. And we're glad you're here.
