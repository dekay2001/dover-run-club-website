    <h2>About Us</h2>
    <p>
        {{ site.title }} has a long history of Tuesday night runs in Dover.
        What started as a regular pub run has grown into a large, loyal group of runners
        who show up rain or shine, summer or winter.
    </p>
    <p>
        There's no membership fee, no sign-up sheet, and no pressure. Just show up at
        <strong><a href="https://thebricknh.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Brick</a></strong> on Tuesdays at 6 PM and you're part of the crew. We run a variety of
        routes around Dover and the surrounding area, and everyone ends up back at the
        pub afterward.
    </p>
    
    <h3>What to Expect</h3>

    <h2>Our Roots</h2>
    <p>
        Dover's running community has deep history, and many of us first found each other through the energy and camaraderie that <strong><a href="https://six03endurance.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SIX03 Endurance</a></strong> brought to the Seacoast. Those weekly pub runs, group races, and shared miles helped shape the culture we still enjoy today.
    </p>
    <p>
        {{ site.title }} continues that spirit—welcoming runners of all paces, celebrating community, and keeping <strong><a href="https://thebricknh.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Brick</a></strong> as our home base. We're proud of where we came from, and excited for where we're going together.
