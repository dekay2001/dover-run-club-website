## What's a Pub Run?

Pub runs are one of our most popular activities! We meet up for a casual run (usually 3-5 miles) and finish at a local pub where we enjoy food, drinks, and great conversation. It's the perfect way to:

- Stay active while being social
- Explore local establishments
- Meet new friends in a relaxed setting
- Reward yourself after a good run!

## Schedule

**Every Wednesday at 6:00 PM**

We rotate through local pubs and restaurants. All paces welcome - we typically have a faster group (7:30-8:30/mile) and a more social group (9:00-11:00/mile).
