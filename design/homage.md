# Homage to Our Roots: Content Planning

**Purpose:** This document contains draft write-ups for honoring Dover Run Club's connection to SIX03 and the running community history. The goal is to acknowledge our roots while staying warm, neutral, and community-focused—avoiding any politics or awkwardness related to organizational changes.

**Use Cases:**
- Short version for homepage "Our Roots" section (with link to full story)
- Long version for standalone "Our Story" page
- Source-of-truth for final copy decisions

## 🌱 Short Version (Warm, Simple, Community-Focused)

**Our Roots**

Dover's running community has deep history, and many of us first found each other through the energy and camaraderie that SIX03 brought to the Seacoast. Those weekly pub runs, group races, and shared miles helped shape the culture we still enjoy today.

Dover Run Club continues that spirit—welcoming runners of all paces, celebrating community, and keeping The Brick as our home base. We're proud of where we came from, and excited for where we're going together.

## 🌳 Long Version (Richer, More Narrative, Still Neutral and Respectful)

**Our Story: Honoring Our Past, Running Toward Our Future**

Dover has always had a strong running heartbeat, and for many years SIX03 played a meaningful role in bringing people together across the Seacoast. Pub runs, group races, holiday gatherings, and countless shared miles helped create a community that felt welcoming, energetic, and fun. Many of our current members—and our home at The Brick—grew out of that era.

Like many things, the pandemic changed the rhythm of group running. Traditions shifted, routines faded, and the community evolved. But the spirit that made those early days special never disappeared. It simply needed a place to grow again.

Dover Run Club was created to carry that spirit forward—not as a replacement, and not as a rebranding, but as a continuation of what has always mattered most: people showing up for each other, week after week, to run, laugh, and belong.

We honor the roots that helped shape this community, and we're grateful for the runners, volunteers, and local partners who built the foundation we stand on today. At the same time, we're excited to write a new chapter together—one that's inclusive, consistent, and grounded in the friendships and shared experiences that make running in Dover special.

Whether you've been part of the Seacoast running scene for years or you're lacing up with us for the first time, you're part of the story now. And we're glad you're here.

## Implementation Notes

**Homepage Integration (index.md):**
- Add "Our Roots" section below the existing "About Us" section
- Use the short version text
- Include "Read Our Full Story →" link to our-story.md
- Style consistently with existing page sections (semi-transparent dark background, orange border)

**Standalone Page (our-story.md):**
- Use `layout: page` front matter
- Full long version narrative
- Hidden from nav initially (Phase 1 single-page approach)
- Accessible via homepage link and direct URL

**Future Considerations:**
- May add to nav when moving beyond Phase 1
- Consider adding timeline graphic or heritage sidebar
- Potential for runner testimonials or photo gallery integration
